    "I ain't better than shit, Jack! You have to turn them on Morty! The shoes need to be turned on! He threatened to turn me in to the government, so I made him and the government go away! That, out there. That's my grave. On one of our adventures Rick and I basically destroyed the whole world. So we bailed on that reality and we came to this one. Because in this one the world wasn't destroyed. And in this one, we were dead. So we came here a-a-and we buried ourselves and we took their place. And every morning, Summer, I eat breakfast 2",
    "Hey listen, you know, if we're all bored over here, wouldn't the common denominator be you? Principal Vagina here, don't let the name fool you; I'm very much in charge. Reminding you that tonight is our annual flu season dance. I don't know how many times I have to say this, but if you have the flu, stay home. The flu season dance is about awareness, not celebration. You don't bring dead babies to Passover. Go home and drink, grandpa. We are created to serve a singular purpose, for which we will go to any lengths to fulfill!",
    "I am not putting my father in a home! He just came back into my life, and you want to, grab him and, stuff him under a mattress like last month's Victoria's Secret?! The algorithm learns your preferences better that way. Plus, if you get in kind of a cool enough relationship, you can sort of follow each other and check out each other's kinks, you know? How do you saddle a fart? Yea. If you spend all day shuffling words around you can make anything sound bad, Morty.",
    "Merchandise Morty, your only purpose in life is to buy & consume merchandise and you did it, you went into a store an actual honest to god store and you bought something, you didn't ask questions or raise ethical complaints you just looked into the bleeding jaws of capitalism and said 'yes daddy please' and I'm so proud of you, I only wish you could have bought more, I love buying things so much Morty. You're talking about Inception? My sister died in the spaghetti. Wha, me irresponsible ?! All I wanted you to do was to hand me a screwdriver, Morty!",
    "Not so fast Morty. You heard your mom. We've got adventures to go on, Morty. Just you and me. And sometimes your sister, and sometimes your mom, but never your dad. You wanna know why, Morty? Because he crossed me. Who cares, Morty? Global acts of terrorism happen every day. Uh, here's something that's never happened beforeâ€”I'm a pickle! I'm Pickle Ri-i-i-ick! Oh, wow. That's an intense line of questioning, Snuffles Puh rum pum pow!"
